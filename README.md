# Analysis-of-KDD-Cup-1999-Dataset

This repository contains a project that focuses on analyzing the KDD Cup 1999 dataset using a pipelining approach. The aim of this project is to achieve a high efficiency rate of 98% in the analysis. The KDD Cup 1999 dataset is a widely-used benchmark dataset in the field of intrusion detection and network security.

### Dataset Description
The KDD Cup 1999 dataset consists of a large collection of network traffic data, which was generated by simulating various types of attacks on a network. The dataset is labeled and contains a mixture of normal and malicious network connections. It is divided into training and testing sets, with each connection in the testing set labeled as either "normal" or one of several attack types.

The dataset provides a rich set of features, including protocol types, service types, flag values, source and destination IP addresses, and many others. These features can be used to build a model that predicts whether a given network connection is normal or an attack.

### Project Overview
The goal of this project is to develop a pipelining approach for analyzing the KDD Cup 1999 dataset and achieve an efficiency rate of 98%. The pipeline will consist of several stages, each performing a specific task in the analysis process. Here is a high-level overview of the pipeline stages:

1. Data Preprocessing: This stage involves cleaning and transforming the raw dataset. It includes tasks such as handling missing values, encoding categorical variables, and normalizing numerical features.

2. Feature Selection: In this stage, we select the most relevant features from the dataset. Feature selection helps reduce dimensionality and improve model performance.

3. Model Training: The selected features are used to train a machine learning model. Various classification algorithms can be employed, such as decision trees, random forests, or support vector machines.

4. Model Evaluation: The trained model is evaluated using the testing set of the KDD Cup 1999 dataset. Evaluation metrics like accuracy, precision, recall, and F1 score will be calculated to assess the model's performance.

5. Hyperparameter Tuning: This stage involves optimizing the model's hyperparameters to further improve its performance. Techniques like grid search or random search can be applied to find the best combination of hyperparameters.

6. Efficiency Enhancement: Additional techniques will be applied to enhance the efficiency of the analysis. This may include parallel processing, feature engineering, or utilizing specialized hardware.

### Results and Discussion
After running the analysis pipeline, the trained model's performance and efficiency will be displayed. The achieved efficiency rate will be 98%, indicating a high level of accuracy in predicting network connections as normal or attacks. The evaluation metrics such as accuracy, precision, recall, and F1 score will also be provided.
